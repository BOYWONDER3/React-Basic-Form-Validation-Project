# This Project was done using useRef and useState to get the comparison and differences between them. 

1. Created a form with an email and password input that check for the following validations:
- Email:
- Required (Cannot be blank)
- Must end in @webdevsimplified.com

- Password:
- Required (Cannot be blank)
- Must Be 10 characters or longer
- Must include a lowercase letter
- Must include an uppercase letter
- Must include a number

2. Displayed error messages next to the inputs every time the form is submitted if there are any. If there are no errors alert the message Success.
3. Excuted the project using both useState and useRef
